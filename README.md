# app3-project-math-painting


The end product of this project is an image file. This image file is going to contain 
some rectangles and some squares.

The user is going to draw the squares by entering some numbers in a command line interface (CLI).

So the user is supposed to enter some numbers and coordinates. The left upper corner 
of a rectangle and then specify the dimensions of the rectangle and Python will draw a rectangle in an image.

The app is deployed on replit. You can use it following the link below:
